<p>Hitting Ultra is my NCAA Hitter Evaluation Model, designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of college hitters by integrating multiple facets of their offensive performance. The model combines traditional statistics with advanced metrics to offer a complete view of a player's abilities, focusing on both actual results and underlying skills.</p> 
<p>Hitting Ultra is a composite metric that integrates five key elements: plate discipline and swing decisions, contact quality, actual results, expected results, and performance against higher-quality pitching. Each of these components is complex, with multiple layers of evaluation behind them, but together they produce a single concise number that captures a hitter’s overall ability.</p>
<p>The strength of Hitting Ultra is that it accounts for the wide variety of hitter profiles. Different players succeed in different ways, yet this metric provides a standardized way to evaluate their impact. It is not intended to be the definitive hitting statistic, but rather a tool that consolidates many measures into one.</p>
<p>The player reports I built go beyond the Hitting Ultra score itself, offering additional context and depth to help explain how and why a hitter performs at a certain level.</p>

<p>The first component of Hitting Ultra is called Eye+, a metric designed to evaluate a hitter’s ability to recognize balls and strikes and demonstrate discipline at the plate. Eye+ considers every pitch a batter faces in a season, analyzing both swing and take decisions in relation to pitch location.</p>
<p>When a hitter swings at a pitch outside the zone, the penalty scales with how far out of the zone the pitch was—a chase at the edge of the zone is treated less harshly than a swing at a pitch well off the plate. Similarly, Eye+ evaluates strike takes. Consistently watching hittable pitches down the middle is not the same as chasing, but it still represents a missed opportunity to create damage and is penalized accordingly.</p>
<p>After processing all swing and take decisions, the model compares the hitter’s performance against league-wide norms, producing a grade that reflects the hitter’s pitch recognition and overall plate discipline.</p>

    To Test the validity of my Eye+ metric, I ran a series of correlation analyses to see whether hitters with higher Eye+ scores also produced stronger results.
    The results show that Eye+ has a strong relationship with BB% (walk rate), with a correlation of 0.46, this indicates that hitters who demonstrate better plate discipline and pitch recognition tend to walk more often, which aligns with the intended purpose of the metric.
    <p>Additionaly I tested Eye+ against K% (strikeout rate) and found a negative correlation of -0.11, while the correlation is not super strong, this suggests that hitters with better Eye+ not only walk more but also strike out less frequently, further validating the effectiveness of the Eye+ metric.</p>
    <p>This metric can be a good underlying metric to see if a hitter has good plate discipline and godd eye at the plate beyond just looking at walk rate and strikeout rate, which can be a good element fro finding undervalued hitters.</p>

<h4 class="bubble-title">Contact+</h4>
     <!-- Text box under hero -->
<div class="hero-textbox">
<p>The second component of Hitting Ultra is Contact+, a metric designed to capture the quality of a hitter’s batted-ball contact. Contact+ evaluates every ball put in play, analyzing key characteristics such as exit velocity and launch angle to generate underlying measures like barrel rate, hard-hit percentage, and launch angle sweet-spot rate.</p>
<p>To add depth, the model groups these results by pitch type, providing insight into how well a hitter handles different offerings across the zone. Finally, each hitter’s numbers are compared against league-wide norms and converted into a concise plus metric, allowing their quality of contact—both overall and by pitch type—to be evaluated on a standardized scale.</p>

  <article class="panel text-panel">
  <p>To validate the Contact+ metric, I conducted correlation analyses to see how well it aligns with traditional performance statistics. The results were promising: Contact+ showed a strong positive correlation of 0.55 with OPS proving that hitters that make good contatc tend to have higher OPS.</p>
  <p>Additionally, Contact+ correlated positively with ISO (Isolated Power) at 0.48, indicating that hitters who excel in quality of contact also tend to hit for more power. These correlations suggest that Contact+ is an effective measure of a hitter’s ability to make strong, impactful contact, reinforcing its value as a key component of the Hitting Ultra model.</p>
  <p>It’s important to emphasize that Contact+ is not a replacement for traditional stats like barrel rate, slugging percentage (SLG), or isolated power (ISO). Instead, it serves as one component of the larger Hitting Ultra equation, designed to consolidate and quantify contact quality within a broader evaluation framework.</p>

<h4 class="bubble-title">xHitting+</h4>
     <!-- Text box under hero -->
<div class="hero-textbox">
<p>The third component of Hitting Ultra is xHitting+, a metric that evaluates a hitter’s expected performance based on the quality of their batted-ball contact. This metric analyzes key inputs such as exit velocity and launch angle, then assigns each batted ball into bins that capture similar contact profiles. From these bins, expected outcomes like xSLG and xwOBA are calculated.
Finally, a hitter’s expected results are compared against league averages, producing a standardized plus metric that reflects how effective their contact quality should be, independent of luck, defense, or ballpark factors.</p>
<p>xHitting+ provides insight into a hitter’s underlying skill level by focusing on the quality of contact they generate, rather than just the actual results. This helps identify players who may be underperforming or overperforming relative to their true ability, making it a valuable tool for player evaluation and projection. 
For example, in the graph below, Vance Honeycutt recorded an xwOBA of 0.737 compared to an actual wOBA of 0.443. This gap indicates that, based on his batted-ball data, he significantly underperformed his expected results. Insights like this can be especially valuable for teams evaluating him as a potential transfer or draft candidate, as they suggest his underlying skill may be stronger than his surface-level statistics indicate. </p>

<h4 class="bubble-title">Battle+</h4>
     <!-- Text box under hero -->
<div class="hero-textbox">
<p>The final component of Hitting Ultra is Battle+, a metric designed to evaluate a hitter’s ability to perform against high-quality pitching. To build this, I incorporated the Stuff+ evaluation from my Pitching Ultra model, using it to grade the quality of every pitch a hitter faced. This allowed the model to account not only for outcomes, but also for the caliber of pitches each hitter encountered. Battle+ uses swing-level data to measure performance:</p>
<li>Missed swing = -1 (negative outcome).</li>
<li>Foul ball = 0 (neutral outcome; does not add or subtract).</li>
<li>Ball in play = graded on contact quality, scaled by the Stuff+ value of the pitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is repeated for every pitch faced, producing a cumulative Battle Score that reflects how well a hitter competes against tougher pitching. In doing so, Battle+ highlights hitters who can still produce quality contact and results even when challenged by elite arms.</p>

<h4 class="bubble-title-big">Other Elements of the Report</h4>   
<div class="hero-textbox">
<P>To complement the Hitting Ultra report i created some additional elements to provide more context and depth to the evaluation:</P>
<ul>
<li>Swing & Miss by Pitch Type: Highlights the pitch types where a hitter struggles most, helping identify weaknesses in their swing profile.</li>
<li>Spray Chart: A visual map of all a hitter’s batted balls, showing distribution across the field to reveal tendencies and hitting patterns.</li>
<li>Exit Velo Heatmap: Displays a hitter’s hot and cold zones, highlighting the areas of the strike zone where they generate the most (and least) damage.</li>
</ul>
