  <h3>Pitching Ultra</h3>
  <p>
    As part of my role as a Baseball Analytics Intern at the University of Miami, I created complete stat lines for each pitcher, covering individual seasons and career totals. Building on this foundation, I developed Pitching Ultra, an advanced player evaluation tool built in R using TrackMan pitch-level data. The project began with cleaning and standardizing the raw data, followed by constructing a comprehensive evaluation model.
  </p>
    Pitching Ultra is a composite “plus” statistic (league average = 100) that integrates multiple performance dimensions: expected results, command ability, actual results, and a proprietary “stuff” grading system that measures pitch effectiveness. I used this model to evaluate both our own pitchers’ performance and potential transfer portal targets.
  </p>
    The model produces both single-season and career metrics, enabling evaluation across different timeframes. For this project, I analyzed data from the 2024 season and the first half of 2025—both separately, to track year-to-year progression or regression, and combined, to evaluate overall performance. Scores above 100 indicate above-average performance, while scores below 100 indicate below-average performance.
    In addition to the composite metric, I evaluated pitchers’ performance by pitch count, including how often they fall behind, their first-pitch strike rate, and their ability to recover when behind in the count.
    <p>
    As part of the Pitching Ultra Evaluation Report, I designed custom visualizations to highlight what makes each pitcher unique. These graphics break down key characteristics, show pitch-type strengths, and detail the specific factors contributing to each pitcher’s Pitching Ultra grade, providing a deeper, more intuitive understanding of their profile.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Pitching Ultra combines results-based (Pitching+) and expected performance (XPitching+) into one evaluator using TrackMan pitch-level data. Outputs power coach-facing reports and leaderboards.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Coaches needed a unified way to compare pitchers across profiles without losing context (pitch mix, command, quality of contact).</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cluster pitches by shape to estimate expected CSW% by type/context</li>
      <li>Command+ from zone templates & miss-distance per pitch type</li>
      <li>Aggregate to pitcher-level with usage-based weighting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved comparison vs. baseline metrics in validation tests</li>
      <li>Automated R Markdown reports (usage, movement comps, heatmaps)</li>
