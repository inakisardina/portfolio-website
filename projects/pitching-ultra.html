    As part of my role as a Baseball Analytics Intern at the University of Miami, I created complete stat lines for each pitcher, covering individual seasons and career totals. Building on this foundation, I developed Pitching Ultra, an advanced player evaluation tool built in R using TrackMan pitch-level data. The project began with cleaning and standardizing the raw data, followed by constructing a comprehensive evaluation model.
  </p>
    Pitching Ultra is a composite “plus” statistic (league average = 100) that integrates multiple performance dimensions: expected results, command ability, actual results, and a proprietary “stuff” grading system that measures pitch effectiveness. I used this model to evaluate both our own pitchers’ performance and potential transfer portal targets.
  </p>
    The model produces both single-season and career metrics, enabling evaluation across different timeframes. For this project, I analyzed data from the 2024 season and the first half of 2025—both separately, to track year-to-year progression or regression, and combined, to evaluate overall performance. Scores above 100 indicate above-average performance, while scores below 100 indicate below-average performance.
    In addition to the composite metric, I evaluated pitchers’ performance by pitch count, including how often they fall behind, their first-pitch strike rate, and their ability to recover when behind in the count.
   <p>
    As part of the Pitching Ultra Evaluation Report, I designed custom visualizations to highlight what makes each pitcher unique. These graphics break down key characteristics, show pitch-type strengths, and detail the specific factors contributing to each pitcher’s Pitching Ultra grade, providing a deeper, more intuitive understanding of their profile.

<h4 class="bubble-title-big">Pitching Plus</h4>
<div class="hero-textbox">
The first part of the Pitching Ultra equation is the Actual results, which is calculated with the Pitching Plus metric I created, which encapsules three metrics, Stuff+, Command+ and Contact+. 
While the Pitching Plus metric does not calculate stats like FIP and era it does take into account things that have actually happened and are more in the pitchers control like commanding the ball, throwing it in good zones, having good stuff that can generate whiffs and limiting hard contact.

    As part of the Pitching Ultra model, I developed a Baseball Savant–style plot that maps each pitcher’s average pitch movement against the league average. Visualization played a key role in building the Stuff+ model, it proved to be an important tool te help people diggest the information easier. 
    <p>The results showed that pitches clustered around league-average movement generally produced much weaker outcomes, while pitches that deviated significantly from average tended to perform better.
    Makes intuitive sense, hitters are more accustomed to “average” pitches and thus handle them more effectively, whereas outlier pitches with unusual movement generate stronger results and improved performance.</p>

    To Test the validity of my Stuff+ metric, I ran a series of correlation analyses to see whether pitchers with higher Stuff+ scores also produced stronger results. Strikeout percentage (K%) is a natural benchmark here, since pitchers with better raw stuff should generate more whiffs and, in turn, more strikeouts. The correlation test showed a positive relationship: Stuff+ and K% correlated at 0.21. While not overwhelming, this is a meaningful sign that pitchers with better stuff do tend to record more strikeouts—though it also reinforces that stuff is just one piece of the puzzle, not the only factor driving performance.
    Beyond strikeouts, quality stuff should also make it harder for hitters to square the ball up. If hitters struggle against elite movement and velocity, they’re more likely to produce weak contact. To test this, I ran a correlation between Stuff+ and soft contact rate, which returned a smaller but still positive relationship (0.13). Again, this shows that while Stuff+ is valuable, it alone doesn’t explain everything.
    That’s why the Pitching Ultra model integrates multiple components. Stuff+ is paired with Command+, and together they feed into Pitching+, a more holistic measure that has shown strong correlations with key outcome stats such as FIP.

  <article class="panel text-panel">
 For this part of the Pitching model, I built a command evaluation tool designed to measure a pitcher’s ability to locate pitches in zones where they are most effective. This tool is not meant to replace traditional stats like strike percentage or walk rate. While pitchers with higher Command+ scores often do show better walk rates, the relationship isn’t absolute. For example, a pitcher could theoretically throw every pitch down the middle and achieve a 100% strike rate, but doing so would almost certainly lead to poor results because of the quality of contact allowed.

Instead, this tool evaluates the quality of each pitch location. Every pitch is graded as Ideal, Non-Ideal, or Bad. In numerical terms, Ideal = 1, Non-Ideal = 0, and Bad = -1. Importantly, “Bad” pitches are scaled by severity—a borderline miss just outside the optimal zone isn’t penalized as harshly as a pitch that misses the target by several feet. This allows the model to capture nuance in command quality rather than treating all misses the same.

    Just as I did with Stuff+, I ran a series of correlation tests to validate the Command+ metric, and the results showed meaningful relationships with several traditional stats.
    The first test examined Command+ against walk rate (BB%). As expected, pitchers with higher Command+ scores tended to issue fewer walks, with a negative correlation of -0.27. While Command+ is not meant to directly measure walk prevention, it makes sense that pitchers who consistently locate in ideal zones allow fewer free passes than those who do not.
    Next, I tested Command+ against strikeout rate (K%). The reasoning was that pitchers who consistently throw competitive pitches put themselves in better positions to earn strikeouts. The analysis supported this hypothesis, showing a positive correlation of 0.11, suggesting that stronger command does contribute—albeit modestly—to generating strikeouts.
    Finally, I tested Command+ against soft contact percentage. The idea was that pitchers who more often locate on the edges rather than the middle of the plate should induce weaker contact. The results again showed a positive correlation (0.11), reinforcing that better command contributes to softer contact.

Overall, Command+ is not a replacement for walk rate or other outcome-based metrics. Instead, it serves as a complementary measure that captures a pitcher’s ability to consistently place pitches in zones that make them competitive and effective.

<h4 class="bubble-title-big">xPitching Plus</h4>
     <!-- Text box under hero -->
<div class="hero-textbox">
Another key component of my model evaluates each pitch’s actual performance—measured through whiffs and quality of contact—against its expected performance based on similar pitches. This comparison helps identify pitchers who are either overperforming relative to their stuff and location or underperforming despite strong pitch traits, making it an important piece of the Pitching Ultra framework.
To build this, I used k-means clustering to group pitches into “buckets” based on shared characteristics such as pitch type, spin, movement, and location. Once the clusters were created, the model compared the actual outcome of a pitch to the typical outcomes of other pitches within its bucket.
From this process, each pitcher receives two values: Actual BCW (Bad Contact Called Strikes and Whiffs) and Expected BCW (xBCW). The difference between these two values is then standardized into a plus metric, allowing every NCAA pitcher to be compared on the same scale.
<p>As with the other metrics, I ran a correlation test to evaluate how the differential between Actual BCW and Expected BCW (xBCW) relates to a traditional statistic like FIP. The results were strong: the xPitching+ differential and FIP showed a correlation of -0.25. This suggests that the metric can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool.
For example, pitchers with negative xStatsDif values and high FIP may be experiencing worse outcomes than expected, meaning poor results could be driven more by luck or variance than by true skill level. Conversely, pitchers with unusually favorable outcomes—those whose FIP is lower than their xStatsDif suggests—may be “lucky” and due for regression.
In this way, the xPitching+ differential helps bridge the gap between underlying pitch quality and traditional outcome-based stats, providing a more complete picture of pitcher performance.</p>

<h4 class="bubble-title-big">Other Elements of the Report</h4>   
<div class="hero-textbox">
To complement the reports, I implemented a series of visualizations that provide a deeper evaluation of each pitcher. These include heatmaps, pitch usage charts, and detailed breakdowns of individual pitch characteristics. In addition, I created a performance table that highlights situational metrics such as first-pitch strike percentage, strikeout rate after falling behind in the count, and the ability (or inability) to put hitters away after gaining an advantage.
Together, these visuals offer valuable context that goes beyond traditional stats, giving coaches actionable insights to support player evaluation and decision-making.
